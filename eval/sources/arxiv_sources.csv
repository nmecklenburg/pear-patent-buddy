0703042,Recommender System for Online Dating Service. Bumble Trading Inc. vs. Match Group (PTAB 2019–2020) – Online Dating Patent,"Users of online dating sites are facing information overload that requires them to manually construct queries and browse huge amount of matching user profiles. This becomes even more problematic for multimedia profiles. Although matchmaking is frequently cited as a typical application for recommender systems, there is a surprising lack of work published in this area. In this paper we describe a recommender system we implemented and perform a quantitative comparison of two collaborative filtering (CF) and two global algorithms. Results show that collaborative filtering recommenders significantly outperform global algorithms that are currently used by dating sites. A blind experiment with real users also confirmed that users prefer CF based recommendations to global popularity recommendations. Recommender systems show a great potential for online dating where they could improve the value of the service to users and improve monetization of the service."
0902.3513,A Systematic Approach to Artificial Agents. Juniper Networks vs. Swarm Technology (PTAB 2022) – Distributed Computing Patent,"Agents and agent systems are becoming more and more important in the development of a variety of fields such as ubiquitous computing, ambient intelligence, autonomous computing, intelligent systems and intelligent robotics. The need for improvement of our basic knowledge on agents is very essential. We take a systematic approach and present extended classification of artificial agents which can be useful for understanding of what artificial agents are and what they can be in the future. The aim of this classification is to give us insights in what kind of agents can be created and what type of problems demand a specific kind of agents for their solution."
1608.02755,Convolutional Oriented Boundaries. Align Technology vs. Dental Monitoring (PTAB 2025) – Dental Imaging Patent,"We present Convolutional Oriented Boundaries (COB), which produces multiscale oriented contours and region hierarchies starting from generic image classification Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). COB is computationally efficient, because it requires a single CNN forward pass for contour detection and it uses a novel sparse boundary representation for hierarchical segmentation; it gives a significant leap in performance over the state-of-the-art, and it generalizes very well to unseen categories and datasets. Particularly, we show that learning to estimate not only contour strength but also orientation provides more accurate results. We perform extensive experiments on BSDS, PASCAL Context, PASCAL Segmentation, and MS-COCO, showing that COB provides state-of-the-art contours, region hierarchies, and object proposals in all datasets."
