US9691429B2,Tiktok v Triller: Systems and methods for creating music videos synchronized with an audio track,"Systems and methods for creating music videos synchronized with an audio track are provided. In some embodiments, an audio track may be selected and one or more video takes may be captured while the selected audio track plays. The video takes may be analyzed while they are captured to determine, for example, a video intensity level and/or a number of faces recognized within each take. By capturing the video takes with the audio track, the video takes may be synchronized to the audio tracks so that they are in time with one another. Portions or subsets of the video takes may be paired or matched with certain sections of the audio track based on, for example, the audio characteristics for a particular section and video characteristics of a particular take."
US20210056320A1,Uber: Pick-up/drop-off zone tracking system,"Aspects of the present disclosure include systems, methods, and devices to facilitate routing of an autonomous vehicle (AV) based on pick-up or drop-off zones (PDZs) that are usable by the AV at destination location. A request for one or more PDZs that are usable by a vehicle to perform a pick-up or drop-off operation at a specified location is received from a vehicular autonomy system of the vehicle. A set of PDZs that are usable by the vehicle at the specified location is identified based on an association between information associated with vehicle and one or more PDZ objects in a data store. Each PDZ object comprising data describing a PDZ. A response is generated based on the set of PDZs and transmitted to the vehicular autonomy system. The response includes at least one PDZ identifier to the set of PDZs."
US20190392357A1,Optimizing group requests for a network-based service, A network system can receive a request data corresponding to a group request for service for multiple users. The request data can indicate a common destination or start location for the multiple users. The system transmits a first set of data to a first user device of the first user to cause the first user device to prompt the first user to input a start or destination location for the first user. The system then identifies a set of service providers to fulfill the group request for service for the multiple users.
US5934226A,Bird diaper,"A bird diaper for an uncaged pet bird to wear, featuring an enclosed pouch for receiving and containing excrement, and apertures to accommodate both the wings and the tail of the bird. Elastic straps and hook and loop fastener components (e.g., VELCRO) secure the diaper onto the body of the pet bird without restricting movement. The bird diaper is fabricated from spandex (e.g., LYCRA) or another stretchable, lightweight material, allowing absorption of bird excrement to prevent leaks and facilitating easy cleaning using soap and water. The bird diaper can incorporate decorative designs, bright colors and is available in different sizes. The bird diaper also has a leash which is insertable within the hook and loop fasteners. The leash serves to restrain or limit the bird's area of free flight."
