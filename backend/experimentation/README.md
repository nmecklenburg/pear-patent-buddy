## Example Cases



### Example 1 - Bumble Trading Inc. vs. Match Group (PTAB 2019–2020) – Online Dating Patent

1. Case:  https://portal.unifiedpatents.com/ptab/case/IPR2019-01000#:~:text=IPR2019,pdf
2. Paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0703042
3. Patent: https://portal.unifiedpatents.com/patents/patent/9959023
4. Deep research description:

In a patent clash between dating-app companies, Bumble petitioned for IPR against Match Group’s U.S. Patent No. 9,733,811 (related to online matchmaking algorithms). Bumble’s petition cited a 2007 arXiv preprint by Brozovsky and Petricek on a “Recommender System for Online Dating” as prior art​. This computer science preprint (available via arXiv in March 2007) predates Match’s patent and was used to argue lack of novelty. The PTAB did institute review, signaling that the reference was deemed sufficiently public. (Notably, the case was settled before a final decision on patent validity, so no written decision analyzed the preprint’s status in depth.) Nevertheless, the Bumble v. Match dispute illustrates how companies use arXiv papers to challenge tech patents, introducing them as printed publications that disclose key concepts earlier. The mere filing of the IPR with an arXiv exhibit put pressure on the patent holder, contributing to a settlement.

4. Deep Resesarch Description:

In another PTAB review (IPR2021-01445), Juniper Networks challenged a patent on distributed computing (US 9,852,004, owned by Swarm Technology). Juniper relied on multiple prior art references, including an arXiv preprint by M. Burgin and G. Dodig-Crnkovic (2009) about “a systematic approach to artificial agents”​. The arXiv paper was introduced to show that the concept of software “agents” performing tasks (a core idea of the patent) was already known. By submitting the 2009 arXiv printout as Exhibit 1013 in the proceeding, Juniper argued the patent lacked novelty or was obvious. The PTAB’s decision (issued in 2023) discussed whether the Burgin preprint was publicly accessible; given arXiv’s reputation and the evidence of the 2009 upload, the reference was treated as prior art. This case underlines that even in highly technical fields (networking and AI), arXiv papers are accepted at the PTAB as prior art on par with journal articles.

### Example - Align Technology vs. Dental Monitoring (PTAB 2025) – Dental Imaging Patent

1. Case: https://portal.unifiedpatents.com/ptab/case/IPR2023-01369
2. Paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.02755
3. Patent: https://patents.google.com/patent/US10755409

In an inter partes review (IPR) at the USPTO’s Patent Trial and Appeal Board, Align Technology challenged Dental Monitoring’s U.S. Patent No. 10,755,409 (related to 3D dental image analysis). Align cited an arXiv preprint by Maninis et al. (2017) on convolutional neural networks as prior art. The PTAB had to first determine if the Maninis paper (submitted to arXiv on April 28, 2017) qualified as a “printed publication” – i.e., was publicly accessible before the patent’s filing date. Align provided evidence of arXiv’s public accessibility policies (e.g. papers are posted within one day of submission and announced to subscribers) and the paper’s metadata​. The Board found the evidence sufficient and held that the arXiv preprint was prior art available before the patent’s priority date​. Ultimately, the PTAB invalidated all challenged claims of the patent as obvious in light of the Maninis preprint combined with other references​. This case confirmed that an arXiv e-print (with a verifiable submission date and public availability) can serve as prior art to invalidate a U.S. patent.
